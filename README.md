## Overview

RentSG is an end-to-end platform that seeks to empower both homeowners and tenants by facilitating seamless onboarding and offboarding rental process for all stakeholders involved. RentSG serves to secure borders by shifting responsibilities of pass verification to tenants, and alleviating homeowners, especially elderlies - whom may be unaware of current process - from current manual processes.

It facilitates the following functions:

- Seamless Verification through Facial Recognition and OCR
- Onboarding of tenants for homeowners through QR verification
- Automated alerts based on realtime pass / lease expiry of tenants
- Owl - An intelligent assistant to faciliate usage of application and enquiries
- Next-of-Kin contacting in case of emergencies when managing tenants

## Getting Started

```bash
